- in today's Massive Wiki Wednesday call we talked about the next steps in refining Mathew's first draft of [[How we measure thinking tools]]  
- as part of that conversation here is a two-slide deck on metrics for scientific dataset usability that Bill constructed in  2017. At that time, the primary objective of these two slides was to illustrate how to specify (or start to specify) metrics of usability of scientific datasets.
