# About this project

**This pilot, spawned by [Fellowship of the Link discussions](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/whw9kgizb7nifqbe6znu5cgrrr), is creating a decentralised map of thinking tools to demonstrate decentralised solutions to collective intelligence.** 

## Vision statement

_tbd_

## Introduction
As explained originally in [[Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs#Bootstrapping upwards|Building collective intelligence from social knowledge graphs]], this is hopefully the first in *"a series of pilot projects where:*

- *the tools we have today are used to link ideas in a specific domain (and the people behind them) together in a decentralised way*
- *in the process **demonstrating** decentralised collective intelligence*
- *we learn from the experience to create a new iteration of slightly better tools as a result, along with a slightly bigger audience,*
- *rinse, repeat.*"

(That post has been developed since into a series, starting [[A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence|here]]).

This pilot project is working with [[Massive Wiki]]. Future projects might try other solutions, or expand this one to work with them. As it's a pilot, moreover, any changes we experiment with here will not necessarily be mainstreamed back into the core massive.wiki sitebuilder. 

## How will this map be structured?

It's built from three types of file:

### Personal profiles

Example:  [[Mathew Lowry]]. Ideally everyone who rates the tools for the spidergraph provides something like this, as each profile ties the other two types of file together with a story about how a real person actually uses them. It includes:

* a series of bullets mentioning different tools and techniques; these will appear automatically in the appropriate tool and technique pages (below)
* the scores they give each tool they use; these are automatically added to the datastore which powers the spidergraph on the [home page](README) 

### Tools & Practices

These are both zettelkasten overviews:
 
* **Practice**: describes a thinking tool practice, e.g., [[inbox curation]] It includes a brief description, link(s) and an automatically created list of the people who use this practice, along with the associated bullet from their profile describing *how* they use it
* **Tool**: similar to a practice, but describes a thinking tool, e.g., [[roam research]] or [[Pocket]], and
	* an automated list of people profiles which use it, along with the associated bullet from their profile describing how they use it
	* **the scores they gave it** (only actual scores included; blanks are not imported).

### Spidergraph executive summary

The figure shows how these all link together and how the scores submitted via Personal Profiles are aggregated into a spidergraph, which provides a sort of "executive summary" entry Point on the home page:

**Personal profiles are key because newcomers need stories as well as scores**. Each personal profile therefore tells the reader: *How** does this person combine **Which** Tools and Practices together*? 

And in every file, of course, each mention of a Tool or Practice links to the zettelkasten overview for that Tool or Practice, where users can discover:

* a description of the tool / practice
* links to explore how different people use it, and the scores they gave it
