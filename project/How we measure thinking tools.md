# How we measure thinking tools

**The dimensions used to characterise thinking tools in the spidergraph on the [home page](README) need to find a balance between usability and granularity.**

This is unlikely to be an easy balance to find, as:

* the people *contributing* this data know the tools well (and so will generally prefer granularity). 
* but *this map is aimed at newcomers*, for whom usability is more important as they try and find their way through this landscape.

We're trying to find a balance, and want to stick to around a dozen dimensions. We're happy to discuss and improve them for future editions of the Map (see [[Project plan]]), so **check out how to contribute below  the table.**

## Current dimensions at a glance

The following table summarises the current dimensions. Note:

* in addition to these dimensions, Personal profiles include a place to score your **Confidence** with each tool or practice. While this seems like a good idea, we're still discussing how to factor Confidence scores into the map.
* all scores (including Confidence) are on a 1-10 scale (terrible - brilliant):

| **Dimension**           | **Definition**                                                                    | **To score highly**                                                                                                                          |

| Openness           | How well does it play with other tools? How interoperable is it? | F/OSS.  Use open standards.  Has an API.  Import/Export  Allow 3rd party plugins.  Available on all OSs, platforms.  Supports structured data      |
| Note-making        | How good is it as a note-making tool?                                             | Good outliner (easy indent/outdent, reorder, fold/zoom...)  Atomic note structure, block references.  Zettelkasten support.                       |

| Idea discovery     | Does it help users organise and (re)discover relevant notes?                      | Backlinks, Good search, AI-driven content discovery                                                                                               |
| User-friendliness  | How easy is it to start benefiting from it, off the shelf?                        | New user can get started and get benefits without taking courses, reading 3 books and 23 blog posts, or installing a dozen plugins              |
| Power              | How powerful, adaptable & configurable is it?                                     | Lots of features, highly customisable, many plug-ins, queryable knowledge, etc.                                                                  |

| Help               | Is it easy to find high-quality documentation and answers to common questions?    | Well-organised onboarding, documentation & FAQ system.                                                                                           |

| Cost               | How expensive is the tool?                                                         | A top score indicates a zero price. High scores indicate a low price and/or a very useful freemium version.                                                                                |
