# How we measure thinking tools

**The dimensions used to characterise thinking tools in the spidergraph on the [home page](README) need to find a balance between usability and granularity.**

This is unlikely to be an easy balance to find, as:

* the people *contributin*g this data know the tools well (and so will generally prefer granularity). 
* but *this map is aimed at newcomers*, for whom usability is more important as they try and find their way through this landscape.

## Phase 1

In Phase 1 of this project:

*  we're trying to find a balance, keeping to around a dozen dimensions 
* we are happy to discuss and improve them while the code is being developed for version 2 - see [[Project plan]]. 

## Dimensions at a glance

The following table summarises [[Dimensions]], which provides more detail. Note:

* in addition to these dimensions, Personal profiles include a place to score your **Confidence** with each tool or practice. While this seems like a good idea, we're still discussing how to factor Confidence scores into the map.
* all scores (including Confidence) are on a 1-10 scale (terrible - brilliant):

| **Dimension**           | **Definition**                                                                    | **To score highly**                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Idea discovery     | Does it help users organise and (re)discover relevant notes?                      | Backlinks, Good search, AI-driven content discovery                                                                                               |
| User-friendliness  | How easy is it to start benefiting from it, off the shelf?                        | New user can get started and get benefits without taking courses, reading 3 books and 23 blog posts, or installing a dozen plugins              |
| Power              | How powerful, adaptable & configurable is it?                                     | Lots of features, highly customisable, many plug-ins, queryable knowledge, etc.                                                                  |

| Cost               | How expensive is the tool?                                                         | A top score indicates a zero price. High scores indicate a low price and/or a very useful freemium version.                                                                                |
