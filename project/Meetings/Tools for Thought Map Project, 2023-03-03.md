## TftMap Builder

- [ ] How to merge the static content (human-written) and dynamic content (as created by the code) on Tool and Practice pages.  The slickest way might be to write the dynamic content to a separate page (e.g., `Obsidian - who, how.md`) and then transclude (embed) that page onto the tool page (e.g. `Obsidian.md`).  To make that work, we'd have to implement transclusion in [[Massive Wiki Builder]]
- [x] Sort order for auto-generated lists of tools and ratings sentences - discussed - decision:
    - [ ] #PK: sort by confidence for tools
    - [ ] tbd for practices

## todos
- [x] #ML edit 'About' to make clear this is a pilot, changes here are not auto-reflected back into massive.wiki as a whole
- [ ] add kanban for project task mgt #PK
- [ ] #ML explore 'how to add "recommended resources" to site, via profile'
    - add task to kanban
    - explore via blogpst
    - get comments
    - discuss
- [ ] apply 'permanent version' feature to entire site? - add idea to kanban #ML
