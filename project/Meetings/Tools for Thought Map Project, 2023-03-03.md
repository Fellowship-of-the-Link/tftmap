## Profile parser

- [ ] How to merge the static content (human-written) and dynamic content (as created by the code) on Tool and Practice pages.  The slickest way might be to write the dynamic content to a separate page (e.g., `Obsidian - who, how.md`) and then transclude (embed) that page onto the tool page (e.g. `Obsidian.md`).  To make that work, we'd have to implement transclusion in [[Massive Wiki Builder]]
- [ ] Sort order for auto-generated lists of tools and ratings sentences
