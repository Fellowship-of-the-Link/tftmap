# Adding Recommended Resources

It's been suggested that the information architecture needs a fourth content type: **Recommended Resources**, defined (roughly, for now) as a useful resource for using a tool and/or practice, or combining them together, etc. Typical Resources would probably include blog posts, online courses, books, videos, etc.

How might that look?

## Today

Currently, as set out in [[About this project]], the information architecture looks like this:
![[tft-map-architecture-v1.png]]

In brief, members submit their personal profiles (appearing in [[People]]), and if they wish contribute to the descriptions of [[Tools]] and/or [[Practices]] (none of these 3 indexes are shown in the image, btw). Massive.wiki plus some custom code then automatically links them together and:

* automatically takes the scores provided by tool users to create an aggregated spidergraph, which provides a sort of "executive summary" entry point, setting out the community's averaged consensus of thinking tools across 11 or so dimensions (we'd love your opinions on these dimensions - see [[How we measure thinking tools]])
* embeds content from each People profile into the corresponding Tools and Practice profiles, transforming the latter into zettelkasten overviews, each providing an "about this tool/practise" text and an automatically created index of "*who uses this tool/practise, and how*"

## Tomorrow?

There are different ways of doing this.

### a) Separate Resource items

![[tft-map-architecture-v2-resources-a.png]]

* How it works:
	* Member submits a file following a "Recommended Resource" template
	* a link to it, along with some key content*, appears wherever relevant: the Member's Profile (if existent), relevant Tools and Practices, etc,
		* **key content includes the any URL** provided in the Recommended Resource, so users can go from a Tool/Practice profile straight to the destination URL, rather than passing through the Resource file
* Key advantages - Members can: 
	* if they wish, submit just Resources - they'll appear wherever relevant (as well as in a Resources menu, not shown); 
	* add plenty of detail about the Resource in the description within the file
* Key disadvantage: quite often all that's actually needed is a URL, so having to submit a file just in order to submit a URL looks like overkill 


### b) Bullet points in the Personal Profile

In this picture, the member includes Recommended Resources as bullet points in his/her People Profile, and the TfTMap builder embeds them wherever relevant. Overall I think this is the better choice, although it probably does (or should) limit the amount of value the member can add to just a few words.

So, which one is best, or can one of these be made better? Post a comment or edit the page directly, as set out in [[How to comment]]. Note that if you do edit the page you can make any changes you like as I've just made a snapshot (aka "permanent version") of this file, as set out in [[Wiki practice meets blogging]].
