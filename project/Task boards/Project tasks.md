## Revision notes

* 2023-04-05 - [[Mathew Lowry]]
	* We experimented with using kanban for the project, but ended up returning to airtable
	* so we closed all tasks here either because they're actually done or they are back in our ToDo list on airtable 
	* the tasks nevertheless appear on the kanban, which is one reason why we went back to airtable
