# How we measure thinking tools

`This is a permanent version, or snapshot, of this page. Please see Revision notes, below, for more details.`

**The dimensions used to characterise thinking tools in the spidergraph on the [home page](README) need to find a balance between usability and granularity.**

This is unlikely to be an easy balance to find, as:

* the people *contributin*g this data know the tools well (and so will generally prefer granularity). 
* but *this map is aimed at newcomers*, for whom usability is more important as they try and find their way through this landscape.

## Phase 1

In Phase 1 of this project:

* we are happy to discuss and improve the following dimensions while the code is being developed for version 2 - see [[Project plan]] and [[How to comment]]
* we've tried to find a balance and keep the number of dimensions to a dozen or less. 

## Dimensions at a glance

The following table summarises [[Dimensions]], which provides more detail. Note:
* in addition to these dimensions, Personal profiles includes a place to score your **Confidence** with the tool or practice. While this seems like a good idea, we're still discussing how to factor Confidence scores into the map.
* all scores (including Confidence) are on a 1-10 scale (terrible - brilliant)

| **Dimension**           | **Definition**                                                                    | **To score highly**                                                                                                                          |

(Sovereignty - you control the files - is better.)                                                                                                                          |
