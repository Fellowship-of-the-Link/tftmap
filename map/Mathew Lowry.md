## My ideal thinking tool(s) 

One tool which supports me in reading, note-making, writing and publishing without forcing me to invest major time in becoming a power user and/or taking expensive courses. In an ideal world it would also handle my todos and time.

How close is my current system (below) to this ideal? Not at all, which is why I'd like to see [[A Minimum Viable Ecosystem for collective intelligence]] emerge.  

## My current tools and practices

* I use  [[inbox curation]] to identify high-priority sources of content: in [[gmail]] I auto-label high-priority [[newsletter]], and I maintain a [[twitter list]]
* I use [[GTD]]: I have recurring [[calendar]] items and tasks to [[scan]] priority sources; [[queue]] the best content to read to [[Pocket]]; read, [[annotate]] and [[tag]] the best content into [[myhub]]
* I also use [[progressive summarisation]] to better embed the knowledge,  via [[zettelkasten]] overviews in [[myhub]], [[enewsletter]] editions and original posts.
* I put all other notes into [[roam research]], almost always starting with the [[daily note]], but am currently migrating to [[Obsidian]]
* I publish via [[myhub]], medium and my [[newsletter]].
