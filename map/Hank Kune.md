## Thinking Tool Ratings

I tried out the 11 dimensions on 3 different analog thinking 'practices': A cognitive habit: 'Suspending Judgment'; A thinking exercise: 'De Bono’s 6 Thinking hats'; and a thinking methodology: Visual thinking (positive cartography).

With some stretching and broader interpretation of the dimensions, the 11 dimensions are useful.

If we wanted to use these for evaluating analog 'cognitive habits', 'thinking exercises' and methodologies, different descriptions of most of the dimensions would be useful.
