One of the [[People]] in this [[Massive Wiki]]. Part of the [[Fellowship of the Link]].

## About me

My most up to date profile, including more social links, can be found in the <a href="https://anagora.org/flancian/" rel="me">node</a> about me in the Agora of Flancia.

You can find my digital garden at https://anagora.org/@flancian.

See also: [Flancia.org](https://flancia.org).

## My ideal thinking tool(s) are...

- Free Software.
- Commons-friendly.

## My current tools and practices

- I currently use mainly [[wiki vim]] to maintain my [[digital garden]], which I host on git: https://github.com/flancian/garden as of the time of writing.
- My main project in this space is the [[Agora]]. My goal is to bootstrap a minimum viable [[Knowledge Commons]] on top of common tools and conventions.
- I also write to the Agora from social media using an [[Agora bot]]. My main social media presence is currently Mastodon: https://social.coop/@flancian.
- I've also used in the past: [[Roam Research]] (would not recommend), [[Obsidian]] (can recommend it, although it's not open source), [[Foam]] (would recommend it to technical users who are comfortable using VSCode), [[Logseq]] (would recommend it).

## Thinking Tool Ratings

TBD.
