## Revision notes

- Created on 2023-03-24 by linking from [[Hank Kune]]. Hank had used "6" instead of "Six", but I used "Six" because de Bono's book title has "Six". We should check with Hank what he thinks is better; popular usage may mean we should prefer the numeral. I did create a redirect page from [[6 Thinking hats]].
